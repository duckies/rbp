        <h2>Too Long, Didn't Read</h2>

        <p>
          Information collected by this website is only done as necessary to facilitate the application process.
          Analytics that may exist on this website are only for ensuring the stability of the website, such as
          collecting error information. Cookies are only used to store the authentication token, thus not requiring
          users to login after closing their browser, and potentially for any togglable website settings.
        </p>

        <h2>Discord &amp; Security</h2>
        <p>
          Our website uses social authentication provided by Discord. The permissions our website requests are narrow,
          only allowing for the following information
          <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#user-object" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Discord User Object</a
          >
          without the email address. For developers, the scope of permissions we request is <b>identify</b>, found on
          the
          <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Discord OAuth2</a
          >
          page. The only identifiable user information given to us are the user's id, username, discriminator or the
          numbers that are combined with the username to form a complete Discord tag, and avatar. The authentication
          flow on Discord's end will confirm the information our website is requesting as well, shown below. This is not
          enough information to allow our service to read or send messages to, or on behalf, of any of our authenticated
          users.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a user joins our website's Discord, the website will then be able to detect that the user is a member of
          our website and send messages to that user as a notification system for our application process. The user is
          able to stop these notifications by simply leaving our guild's Discord at any time.
