      <h3>Trialing Process</h3>
      <p>
        Trials are evaluated over an approximate three-week period in which the
        trial participates in boss kills. The duration of the trial and its
        methodology are at the discretion of the officers. What content the
        trial is brought to is dependent on their gear, experience, and our
        current progression schedule. Certain progression decisions, like
        holding a lockout to work on a progression boss, can elongate a trialing
        period. However, if we see the trial perform to our satisfaction in
        raids, and with no glaring problems as discussed between the officers
        and the trial, they will be promoted to Raider. Failing a trial may
        result in retrialing, demotion to a social rank, or removal from the
        guild.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trials are required to understand our policies and carry out the
        expectations we expect of all our raiders. Adaptation to our policies
        and practices is something an Officer will look at as part of the
        evaluation.
